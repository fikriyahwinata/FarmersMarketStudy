This dataset contains locations of farmers market obtained from The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
I downloaded in March 2017, so dataset of locations updated up to March 2017. Health outcomes data gathered from
the County Health Ranking and Roadmap https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ also gathered in March 2017. I cleaned
these two dataset and selected some variables from County Health Ranking and Roadmap for the CPSC541 BYOD project.
Also, I added some health outcomes data from in 2010, just in case I want to compare with 2016 data.
